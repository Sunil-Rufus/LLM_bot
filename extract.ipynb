      "Last November, a team from the University at Buffalo entered the highly competitive Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge.  \n",
      "Share This\n",
      "Print\n",
      "âRegardless of the final outcome, it has been a valuable experience, allowing us to learn about user behavior during conversations, as well as what it takes to effectively leverage neural text generators. Iâm also grateful to have had a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists and linguists and the complementary expertise they bring. This is a strength, and has compensated for us having a relatively small team compared to our competitors.â\n",
      "Rohini Srihari, professor and associate chair\n",
      "Department of Computer Science and Engineering\n",
      "While the multimillion-dollar competition is in its fourth year, this was the first time UB had participated in the challenge of creating a socialbot âthat can converse coherently and engagingly for 20 minutes with humans on a range of current events and popular topics such as entertainment, sports, politics, technology and fashion.â\n",
      "The members of Team Proto, Sougata Saha and Souvik Das, PhD students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and Elizabeth Soper and Erin Pacquetet, PhD students in the Department of Linguistics, were happy to have the opportunity, not knowing how far they would go in a pool with other esteemed colleagues from around the globe.\n",
      "Since then, the team, under the direction of Rohini Srihari, professor and associate chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, has drawn on their complementary skills and knowledge throughout the progressive months and levels of the competition. Thus far, the teamâs socialbot has been judged by people everywhere, including over 55,000 users during the semifinal phase alone.\n",
      "Now, nearly a year after their original application was accepted, the team has become one of only five to advance to the finals stage of the competition. They are competing against the University of California Santa Cruz, Czech Technical University (Prague), Stanford University and Emory University. Stanford and Emory are both previous winners of the competition.\n",
      "The finals will be conducted over a three-day period later this month. During this time, the socialbots will be evaluated by a panel of experts. While this phase does not specifically stipulate any additional features, the team has been hard at work on some overall enhancements that they think will be help distinguish their socialbot from the others. These include innovations regarding their socialbotâs ability to converse on any topic, the ânaturalnessâ of conversation and reacting to various user behaviors that they have observed throughout testing.\n",
      "The winning team, which will receive a prize of $500,000, will be announced by the end of July.\n",
      "âRegardless of the final outcome, it has been a valuable experience, allowing us to learn about user behavior during conversations, as well as what it takes to effectively leverage neural text generators,â says Srihari. âIâm also grateful to have had a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists and linguists and the complementary expertise they bring. This is a strength, and has compensated for us having a relatively small team compared to our competitors.â\n",
      "We caught up with Srihari to hear all about where the team is now â and where they hope their work will lead them.\n",
      "What has the team learned as this competition has gone on?\n",
      "Our learning has been in two areas. First, we have learned a lot about how users react to conversational AI systems: what gets them excited and wanting to continue a conversation, what they find less interesting, and what spooks them out. Second, on the technology side, we have learned a lot about effectively leveraging the latest deep learning technology, in particular, neural text generation. We have also learned about the ebb and flow of a conversation and how to algorithmically control this, for example, when to let the user steer the conversation. When we first started, most of our socialbot utterances were generated through knowledge engineering approaches, based on deep domain knowledge of how people converse about topics such as movies or games. Only a small fraction of the Proto utterances were generated through the neural text generation models. Now the situation has flipped, with most of the utterances being generated through neural models. This allows us to converse on a far wider range of topics.\n",
      "What impact do you hope that your work in this field will have?\n",
      "Conversational AI systems are in a nascent stage. Currently we are focused on just the ability to conduct human-like conversations. However, these socialbots have tremendous potential for societal impact. We are particularly interested in conducting purposeful conversations, for example, encouraging people to pursue health-related goals, and of course, in helping to combat disinformation.\n",
      "Is there anything people misunderstand about AI that you would like them to know?\n",
      "Perhaps the fear that AI systems can think and learn completely on their own and thus become harmful to individuals and society. AI systems perform based on (i) the models that scientists design to implement the solutions, and perhaps even more important, (ii) the data that the systems are trained on. Currently, socialbots are limited in their abilities due to the lack of representative training data sets. Itâs hard for socialbots to narrate anecdotes about personal experiences, or express emotions. We have a long way to go.\n",
      "Is there anything the UB community can do to support the team at this phase of the competition?\n",
      "Ideally, we would have liked the UB community to help us test out the socialbot. However, due to the logistics involved, this is difficult since it involves physical proximity to a device used by our team members. Still, all the encouragement from our colleagues and the UB community at large have generated a lot of positive energy for our team!\n",

      "âBeing chosen by the National Science Foundation to lead this impactful initiative underscores the pivotal role our world-class researchers play in addressing societyâs most pressing challenges, including cultivating just and inclusive environ-ments that enable young learners to flourish. â\n",
      "President Satish K. Tripathi\n",
      "UB has been awarded a highly competitive grant by the National Science Foundation to establish a national institute to develop artificial intelligence systems that identify and assist young children with speech and/or language processing challenges.\n",
      "The five-year, $20 million effort will address the nationwide shortage of speech-language pathologists and provide services to children ages 3 to 10 who are at increased risk of falling behind in their academic and socioemotional development â issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "The award, which UB will use to create the AI Institute for Exceptional Education, also will advance foundational AI technologies, human-centered AI design, and learning science that improve educational outcomes for young children. It is one of the largest federal research grants received by UB, New Yorkâs flagship university.\n",
      "âThe University at Buffalo is deeply committed to harnessing our research and educational excellence for the greater good, and our faculty have long been pioneers in the development of cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems,â said President Satish K. Tripathi. âBeing chosen by the National Science Foundation to lead this impactful initiative underscores the pivotal role our world-class researchers play in addressing societyâs most pressing challenges, including cultivating just and inclusive environments that enable young learners to flourish.â\n",
      "Venu Govindaraju, vice president for research and economic development, is the grantâs principal investigator.\n",
      "âThere simply arenât enough speech-language pathologists in the United States and, as a result, children are not receiving life-changing interventions soon enough,â said Govindaraju, SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. âOur multidisciplinary team will create advanced artificial intelligence systems that address this critical problem, allowing for earlier diagnoses and tailored interventions that close educational gaps and create more inclusive learning environments where children thrive both academically and socially.â\n",
      "The AI Screener will collect samples of childrenâs speech, facial expressions, gestures and other data, creating weekly summaries of these interactions. These summaries will help teachers monitor their studentsâ speech and language processing abilities and, if needed, suggest a formal evaluation with a speech-language pathologist.\n",
      "Institute will help underserved students\n",
      "The AI Institute for Exceptional Education will focus on serving the millions of children nationwide who, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, require speech and language services.\n",
      "Specially, it will develop two advanced AI solutions: the AI Screener for early identification of potential speech and/or language impairments and disorders, and the AI Orchestrator, which will act as a virtual teaching assistant by providing students with ability-based interventions.\n",
      "The AI Screener will listen to and observe children in the classroom, collecting samples of childrenâs speech, facial expressions, gestures and other data. It will create weekly summaries of these interactions that catalogue each childâs vocabulary, pronunciation, video snippets and more. These summaries will help teachers monitor their studentsâ speech and language processing abilities and, if needed, suggest a formal evaluation with a speech-language pathologist.\n",
      "This is critical because, typically, the earlier speech and language concerns are addressed, the greater the likelihood children will excel academically and socioemotionally.\n",
      "The AI Orchestrator is an app that will help speech-language pathologists, most of whom have average caseloads so large that they are forced to provide group-based interventions for children instead of individualized care. The app addresses this by recommending personalized content tailored to studentsâ needs. It continues to monitor studentsâ progress and adjusts lesson plans to ensure that the interventions are working.\n",
      "The research team will ensure that data collected by the AI Screener and the AI Orchestrator adheres to ethics and privacy guidelines. Information about these plans will be shared with participants. Initially, the team intends to deploy prototypes of each system to roughly 80 classrooms, reaching 480 kindergartners. \n",
      "Institute comprised of top research universities\n",
      "The institute will consist of more than 30 researchers from nine universities including UB; the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Stanford University; the University of Washington; Cornell University; the University of Nevada, Reno; the University of Texas at El Paso; Penn State University; and the University of Oregon.\n",
      "These scholars specialize in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, social robotics, communicative disorders, diversity and inclusivity, learning science, communication and other fields.\n",
      "Govindaraju and UB researchers Jinjun Xiong and Srirangaraj Setlur will coordinate the teamâs work.\n",
      "Xiong, an Empire Innovation Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, is a co-principal investigator, and will serve as the instituteâs scientific director and co-director. Setlur, a principal research scientist in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, will serve as the instituteâs managing director.\n",
      "Additional co-principal investigators include David Feil-Seifer, associate professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at University of Nevada, Reno; Pamela Hadley, professor and department head of the Department of Speech and Hearing Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Julie Kientz, professor and chair of the Department of Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington.\n",
      "In addition to Govindaraju, Xiong and Setlur, the institute will include 13 UB researchers representing the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Graduate School of Education.\n",
      "Letitia Thomas, assistant dean for diversity in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, will lead the broadening participation and diversity, equity and inclusion sections of the grant.\n",
      "X. Christine Wang, associate dean for research at the Graduate School of Education and director of the Fisher-Price Endowed Early Childhood Research Center at UB, will lead the education and workforce development section of the research and assist the field testing. \n",
      "âThe educational tools that this interdisciplinary team of researchers will create has the potential to have a profound impact in the classroom, both for educators and students,â said Wang, professor of early education and learning sciences in the Graduate School of Education.\n",
      "Building upon UBâs rich history of AI research\n",
      "The award builds upon a rich history of AI research at UB that dates back decades to when computer scientists, including Govindaraju, developed a handwriting-recognition system that has saved the U.S. Postal Service hundreds of millions of dollars by automating the sorting of mail.\n",
      "More recently, UB has made strategic investments in both people and programs to enhance the universityâs national leadership in AI, including forming the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and the Center for Information Integrity.\n",
      "âThe institute will launch new, innovative courses at the intersection of AI and education to help prepare the next generation of undergraduate and graduate students to excel at multidisciplinary research that can have broad societal impact,â said Provost A. Scott Weber. âThe instituteâs pathbreaking research will raise UBâs profile as an AI powerhouse and attract the best students from around the world and help the university elevate its ranking.â\n",
      "Tripathi praised congressional leaders for their continued support of UB, whose mission is to bring the benefits of its research and scholarship to local and global communities in ways that impact and positively change the world.\n",
      "âWe want to thank U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Congressman Brian Higgins for their longstanding support of federally funded university research. Time and again they have demonstrated how deeply they value the ability of academic research to solve real-world problems, and their commitment is creating opportunities for people across our state and nation to thrive,â he said.\n",

      "\"I was going to do math first,\" said Meg Arnold.  \"I came in as both math and computer science.  I took a computer science class in high school but didn't think it was something I was going to pursue.  But I like computer science classes.  I still use math-oriented logic skills and I still like the theory, but I like the practicality and applicability of computer science.  Mesh it with something medical down the road or something artsy down the road.\"\n",
      "Meg, a self-described military brat, finished high school in Chittenango, N.Y., following stints in North Dakota, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Colorado.  Why UB? That's easy.  \"Cost.\"  When she and her dad visited CSE's open house, Nick Di Rienzo (CS BS '15) gave a talk about his experiences at Google, first as an intern and then as a new hire.  Meg's dad was sold: \"UB is the cheapest school you applied to and all these kids have all these opportunities.\"  \"So I decided to stick it out with computer science,\" Meg continued.  \"But they do have the math department here.  You can do literally whatever you want.  I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted to do and the open house enlightened me.\"\n",
      "In her years in CSE, Meg has added practically every student leadership role to her CV: UB ACM Chapter President.  Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) for Carl Alphonce and later for Atri Rudra.  CSE Student Advisory Board Chair.  TechSavvy volunteer.  Student Association fundraiser.  Open house presenter.  UB Hacking '16 co-director, with Sanjee Choudhery: \"We've always gotten more people every year.  I wanted to make sure we continued that.  We had at least 350 or 400 this year.  And we had Indian food, Chinese food, not just pizza.\"\n",
      "Meg has a job lined up at Bloomberg in New York City.  She'll start apartment shopping the day after graduation.  \"All my friends are there, and they all work at Bloomberg,\" she said.\n",

      "James Droste wears a black UB Network Defense jacket with his hacker code name, debug, embroidered on the sleeve. It's a sleek look for the captain of the UB team that competed in the 2016 Northeast Collegiate Cyberdefense Competition, hosted at RIT, at which UB took third place.\n",
      "\"The entire weekend was designed to make us sweat the entire time,\" James recalled. \"Constantly being attacked, trying to get stuff done. It's meant to be a very high pressure situation to say the least. We typically don't sleep, up 'til 3 a.m., back up at 9 a.m. It's fun when they rm -rf a box. They reweaponized a virus called Shamoon. They put it on all our boxes so it would turn our boxes off. It triggered an alert, and because it was the same virus, we thought the real virus was back. General antics from the red team.\"\n",
      "The red team is the offensive squad that challenges the cyberdefenders, made up of industry professionals who perform penetration testing for a living. They work for government agencies and private security contractors. \"This is the only time they can let loose and not care if things work or not after they leave,\" James said. \"They're people heavy inside the information security community.\"\n",
      "James, from Nanuet, NY, got started in cyberdefense when he met former CSE sysadmin Kevin Cleary. \"When I was interviewing to be a CSE 101 teaching assistant, Kevin was one of my interviewers. I'm amazed by the stuff I was able to do in Davis 339C, CSE's student server room. That's my second home.  I can bring up and manage a whole network infrastructure. That's something I never thought I'd be able to do.\"\n",
      "James will join the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Operations Team in Seattle, WA, after he graduates in May. \"When you email aws-security, we're the team that handles that,\" he said. \"If one of your EC2 instances got hacked, we're your team.\" He interned at Amazon's Herndon, Va. location between his junior and senior years.  Because AWS runs such a high percentage of commercial websites, \"I actually got to protect the Internet.\"\n",
      "He looks forward to living in Seattle. \"Everything's walkable and I'll be in the city, so it's pretty sick. Our floor was awesome. It's so high up, the view is incredible. They allow dogs in the workplace, so we have two dogs on the team, too.\"\n",
      "James doesn't rule out joining the real-life red team at some point in the future. \"I see it as my military service.  I could do that to give back to the country.\"\n",

      "âThe two eyes should have very similar reflective patterns because theyâre seeing the same thing. Itâs something that we typically donât typically notice when we look at a face. â\n",

      "Department of Computer Science and Engineering\n",
      "BUFFALO, N.Y. â University at Buffalo computer scientists have developed a tool that automatically identifies deepfake photos by analyzing light reflections in the eyes.\n",
      "The tool proved 94% effective with portrait-like photos in experiments described in a paper accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing to be held in June in Toronto, Canada.\n",
      "âThe cornea is almost like a perfect semisphere and is very reflective,â says the paperâs lead author, Siwei Lyu, PhD, SUNY Empire Innovation Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. âSo, anything that is coming to the eye with a light emitting from those sources will have an image on the cornea.\n",
      "âThe two eyes should have very similar reflective patterns because theyâre seeing the same thing. Itâs something that we typically donât typically notice when we look at a face,â says Lyu, a multimedia and digital forensics expert who has testified before Congress.\n",
      "The paper, âExposing GAN-Generated Faces Using Inconsistent Corneal Specular Highlights\n",
      ",â is available on the open access repository arXiv.\n",
      "Co-authors are Shu Hu, a third-year computer science PhD student and research assistant in the Media Forensic Lab at UB, and Yuezun Li, PhD, a former senior research scientist at UB who is now a lecturer at the Ocean University of Chinaâs Center on Artificial Intelligence.\n",
      "Tool maps face, examines tiny differences in eyes\n",
      "When we look at something, the image of what we see is reflected in our eyes. In a real photo or video, the reflections on the eyes would generally appear to be the same shape and color.\n",
      "However, most images generated by artificial intelligence â including generative adversary network (GAN) images â fail to accurately or consistently do this, possibly due to many photos combined to generate the fake image.\n",
      "Lyuâs tool exploits this shortcoming by spotting tiny deviations in reflected light in the eyes of deepfake images.\n",
      "To conduct the experiments, the research team obtained real images from Flickr Faces-HQ, as well as fake images from www.thispersondoesnotexist.com, a repository of AI-generated faces that look lifelike but are indeed fake. All images were portrait-like (real people and fake people looking directly into the camera with good lighting) and 1,024 by 1,024 pixels.\n",
      "The tool works by mapping out each face. It then examines the eyes, followed by the eyeballs and lastly the light reflected in each eyeball. It compares in incredible detail potential differences in shape, light intensity and other features of the reflected light.\n",
      "âDeepfake-o-meter,â and commitment to fight deepfakes\n",
      "While promising, Lyuâs technique has limitations.\n",
      "For one, you need a reflected source of light. Also, mismatched light reflections of the eyes can be fixed during editing of the image. Additionally, the technique looks only at the individual pixels reflected in the eyes â not the shape of the eye, the shapes within the eyes, or the nature of whatâs reflected in the eyes.\n",
      "Finally, the technique compares the reflections within both eyes. If the subject is missing an eye, or the eye is not visible, the technique fails.\n",
      "Lyu, who has researched machine learning and computer vision projects for over 20 years, previously proved that deepfake videos tend to have inconsistent or nonexistent blink rates for the video subjects.\n",
      "In addition to testifying before Congress, he assisted Facebook in 2020 with its deepfake detection global challenge, and he helped create the âDeepfake-o-meter,â an online resource to help the average person test to see if the video theyâve watched is, in fact, a deepfake.\n",
      "He says identifying deepfakes is increasingly important, especially given the hyper-partisan world full of race-and gender-related tensions and the dangers of disinformation â particularly violence.\n",
      "âUnfortunately, a big chunk of these kinds of fake videos were created for pornographic purposes, and that (caused) a lot of â¦ psychological damage to the victims,â Lyu says. âThereâs also the potential political impact, the fake video showing politicians saying something or doing something that theyâre not supposed to do. Thatâs bad.â\n",

      "âThe University at Buffalo is a groundbreaker in the field. â\n",
      "SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence is much more than ChatGPT. Itâs a tool that can help professionals â from scientists and teachers to physicians and farmers â make data-informed decisions to address societyâs most pressing challenges.\n",
      "UB stands at the forefront of AI research and exploration. This was evident during the Sept. 6 launch of a panel discussion series called UB | AI Chat Series, âHarnessing AI for Public Good.â\n",
      "SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. joined President Satish K. Tripathi in Capen Hall to kick off the series that features faculty members from a variety of disciplines who are developing ways to use AI for the betterment of society. Approximately 60 audience members from the UB community attended.\n",
      "âThe University at Buffalo is a groundbreaker in the field,â said King, who noted that UB recently received $20 million from the National Science Foundation to fund its new National AI Institute for Exceptional Education.\n",
      "The institute, which is designed to ensure that children with speech and language disorders do not fall behind academically, is among several cutting-edge AI initiatives at UB. Others include the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and the Center for Information Integrity.\n",
      "âToday weâre here to discuss an area of interdisciplinary strength that has implications for every aspect of our life â from our homes and health to education, transportation, communication, national security and much more,â Tripathi said. âIâm speaking, of course, about artificial intelligence.â\n",
      "Venu Govindaraju, vice president for research and economic development and SUNY Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, moderated the discussion with four faculty members.\n",
      "The panel discussion launched the new series UB | AI Chat Series, \"Harnessing AI for the Public Good. Photos: Douglas Levere and Meredith Forrest Kulwicki\n",
      "First, he laid out a timeline of AIâs influence and highlighted UBâs decades-long leadership in the field, including work in the 1990s when Govindaraju â along with a team of faculty, staff and students â led a project that developed a machine-learning system for postal mail, saving the U.S. Postal Service millions of dollars.\n",
      "In the ensuing decades, AI has been harnessed to make robots that simulate human emotions, social media algorithms that measure user experience and virtual assistants that can provide seemingly infinite amounts of information.\n",
      "âThe volume and complexity of data is too vast for humans to process,â Govindaraju said. âWhat computers can process in one second would take 36 billion years for humans.â[CN1]\n",
      "Over the next hour, he directed questions to the panel members who have studied AI from a variety of viewpoints:\n",
      "Ciprian âChipâ Ionita, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, which is a joint program of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.\n",
      "Christine Wang, professor in the Department of Learning and Instruction and director of the Fisher-Price-Endowed Early Childhood Research Center in the Graduate School of Education.\n",
      "Ifeoma Nwogu, associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and co-director of graduate studies in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.\n",
      "David Castillo, professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, College of Arts and Sciences, and co-director of the Center for Information Integrity.\n",
      "Govindaraju asked questions about everything from what AI means to them to its potential to benefit and improve specific industries and services.\n",
      "Ionita noted that AI can help stroke victims communicate and guide surgeons in predicting patient outcomes based on information discovered during procedures. And in the near future, he said, wearable devices will help detect chronic diseases earlier and save lives.\n",
      "âAI continues to make progress in medicine,â Ionita said. âThe key is to make it transparent for physicians and explainable to the public.â\n",
      "Wang said AI can aid K-12 classroom teaching, including personalized learning for students with a range of learning styles and abilities, as well as augmented reality that allows teachers to do things like take students on virtual field trips.\n",
      "At the same time, Wang emphasized the importance of instilling soft skills in students so that they will be good communicators and patient with those with differing viewpoints.\n",
      "âWe have to think critically about how AI impacts our lives,â Wang said. âWhat are the ethical concerns? What will be the most effective and equitable for young learners?â \n",
      "The talk Wednesday marks the beginning of a two-year series that will highlight how UB researchers from across academic disciplines are using AI to improve society.\n",
      "Chancellor John B. King meets with UB deans (left) and students at UB's Blackstone LaunchPad. Photos: Douglas Levere and Meredith Forrest Kulwicki\n",
      "King noted the important role that faculty members play in helping to understand a changing world.\n",
      "âIn such times educators and researchers must be beacons of insight and morality, of common sense and uncommon insight, of explanation and observation, and of, more than anything else, a reverence for knowledge, a desire to advance understanding, and a wish that all which we discover will better the lives of our planetâs inhabitants,â King said.\n",
      "Prior to the panel discussion, King met with students who are participating in Blackstone LaunchPad, an experiential campus program designed to introduce entrepreneurship as a viable career path. \n",
      "âIt was exciting to hear from the students and see their energy,â King said. âBlackstone provides opportunities for internships, mentoring and academic learning in a real-world environment.â\n",

      "Alex Liu\n",
      "BS, Computer Science, May 2021 (expected)\n",
      "Alex Liu is a senior in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He also recently founded the Science and Computing Club (SoCo). The student organization aims to bring together students from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and beyond to discuss current, pressing issues like political polarization on social media, technology addiction, and algorithmic bias.  \n",
      "âI enjoy how research-oriented the professors are, and how open they are to working with undergraduates. â\n",
      "Alex Liu, undergraduate student\n",
      "Computer Science\n",
      "Where are you from?\n",
      "Rochester, N.Y.\n",
      "Why did you choose to go into engineering?\n",
      "My dad got me into coding when I was young. Plus, the grade school that I went to was very STEM-oriented so that also inspired me to pursue engineering. \n",
      "What do you like most about engineering at UB?\n",
      "I enjoy how research-oriented the professors are, and how open they are to working with undergraduates. Some of the projects I've helped out with and heard about have been really rewarding and interesting.\n",
      "What motivated you to start the Society and Computing Club?\n",
      "For a good part of my undergraduate career I've been interested in computer science topics like algorithms, machine learning, and big data. Aside from a few ethics-related assignments in my CS classes, most of my understanding of the negative effects of these industries has come from science fiction, be it AI ruling the world or algorithms that determine future-criminals before they become them (I've only understood recently that this is indeed happening in real life). \n",
      "Watching the documentary The Social Dilemma changed all that. Not only did I begin to learn how real and pervasive the effects of computing on society were, but I also noticed how much it affected my own life. Seeing scenes in the documentary like getting sucked down a YouTube rabbit hole, worrying about your image on social media, and feeling the addictive urge to check your cell phone were especially powerful because I have personally experienced all of these behaviors. The biggest gut punch was when I realized that the academic interests I mentioned â algorithms, machine learning, big data â were the very technologies that enabled these behaviors. This is the reason why I started the Society and Computing Club: As an engineer, to learn how I can create technologies responsibly and ethically in my future career; As a citizen, to understand the effects of computing on democracy, mental health, privacy, and other aspects of society.\n",
      "What are the goals of Society and Computing?\n",
      "Society and Computing (SoCo) does not claim to have the answers to the problems that we discuss, such as political polarization on social media, technology addiction, and algorithmic bias. Rather, our main goal is just to start a conversation around these problems among the student population. And to fully respect the breadth and depth of these problems, we will need as diverse a body of people as possible involved in this conversation. That's why another one of my goals for this club is to be interdisciplinary, both in terms of the student body, but also in terms of the faculty speakers we bring in. The final goal is to promote research projects related to society and computing that faculty are performing around campus.\n",
      "Is there anything particularly exciting that your organization is doing?  \n",
      "Yes! For our inaugural event, we will be discussing the documentary The Social Dilemma. We're also really excited about our upcoming speaker series, starting in March. We anticipate having UB professors in philosophy, communications, and computer science talk about their research and work related to society and computing. Some topics include AI ethics, political speech on social media, and machine learning in society. \n",
      "What are you working on right now?\n",
      "I'm working on getting the word of this club out to students. We currently have lots of interest from within the CSE department, but there is a lot more outreach to be done within SEAS as a whole, and also outside SEAS. Besides that, we're working to recruit more faculty to come join our speaker series!\n",
      "What are you passionate about?\n",
      "I'm passionate about learning from a diverse array of fields, not just that of my major. Many of the questions we want to ask in this club cannot be solved by computer science and engineering alone. We need to examine these problems from all different academic angles, and I want to prepare myself for that. \n",
      "Has there been a particular faculty member that has been formative during your time at UB?\n",
      "Professor Atri Rudra has been instrumental in my development as a student and researcher. I took his introductory algorithms class a few years back and really enjoyed it. After that class, I did (and still am doing) theoretical computer science research with him. It was during our research meetings that the idea for SoCo was seeded, and he was instrumental in helping me get this club up and running. Through this process we discovered our mutual interest in society and computing related topics, and he was able to introduce me to many other faculty members that helped the club's start in one way or another. In all these settings, Atri has been honest, insightful, and overall a great person to talk to. It's been awesome getting to know him over my undergraduate career!\n",
      "What are your future plans?\n",
      "Right now my plan is to pursue a PhD after I graduate. Hopefully I will be able to do research that is relevant to SoCo, as that is my primary interest. \n",
      "What is your advice for prospective students?\n",
      "My main advice to prospective students is to challenge yourself to be as interdisciplinary of a student as possible. This could mean taking as many classes as possible outside of your major, getting involved in interdisciplinary clubs, or adding a minor or a second major (finances and time permitting). \n",
      "Personally, I've really enjoyed taking non-STEM courses not because I don't enjoy STEM, but because doing so has actually enhanced my experience as a STEM major. First, I believe that doing so directly improves your skills within your own major. As an example, my experience reading court case arguments in law class has made me much better at writing proofs for theoretical computer science courses and research. Second, you will be introduced to all sorts of cool and new academic fields. This happened to me after I took an economics class, when I discovered the wonderful world of game theory sitting at the intersection of economics and computer science. Most importantly, stepping outside your academic comfort zone is a great way of introducing yourself to fresh ways of thinking and looking at the world, while sharpening your own critical thinking skills. \n",

      "âHere, there are different career opportunities, and good opportunities in industry as well. â\n",
      "Luigi Di Tacchio\n",
      "PhD Candidate '18\n",
      "Published April 4, 2017\n",
      "This content is archived.\n",
      "by Christian Miller\n",
      "Luigi Di Tacchio is CSE's first Italian PhD student (from Rome). But he may be at the forefront of a wave; he's subsequently been joined by Gian Pietro Farina (PhD candidate, from Perugia) and Marco Gaboardi (assistant professor).\n",
      "Luigi first came to UB as an exchange student from La Sapienza, the famous \"University of Rome.\" \"I wanted to enjoy the experience and gain some skills in academia or industry,\" Luigi said. \"I like the idea of doing something new, it's like a challenge.\"\n",
      "His first night in Buffalo certainly qualified as that. He arrived in the middle of the night, in a snowstorm (\"I never experienced snow before in my life\"), and without a room. \"I felt really lost and didn't know where to go,\" he said. Eventually, a helpful Campus Living staffer put him up in the Governors Complex for the night. \n",
      "More cultural challenges followed: speaking the language, getting a credit card (Italians typically use cash and debit cards, but not credit cards), where to eat, where to buy groceries. Despite these troublesome logistics, there was one compelling reason that made the transcontinental move worthwhile.\n",
      "\"We really don't do research so much in Italy,\" Luigi explains. \"When we're undergrads, we don't do research at all. In Italy, the PhD is associated with academia. Only if you want to become a professor do you get a PhD. Here, there are different career opportunities, and good opportunities in industry as well.\"\n",
      "\"He is a great PhD student in all aspects,\" said Tevfik Kosar, Luigi's advisor. \"Perfect GPA, excellent research, and sought-after TA.\"\n",
      "Luigi's PhD topic is energy efficiency in cloud computing. He became interested in this area while writing his MS thesis on energy efficiency in filesystems. \"It's a natural progression,\" he said. \"I can reuse some of the knowledge I've gained in the last few years. This is a topic that has a future, a relatively new topic. Filesystems are implemented mostly at the software level, and energy improvements are made by accesses of data location. Efficiency at cloud can be done at the hardware level and at software-level scheduling. We can redirect accesses at the data level to put some hardware to sleep or in energy-saving mode.\"\n",
      "He's also cultivated a reputation as a masterful teacher. In 2016, he won the CSE Best Graduate Teaching Award for his work in CSE 115/116: Intro to Programming, CSE 421/521: Operating Systems, and CSE 487/587: Data Intensive Computing. \"Having to deal with different people with different attitudes is an invaluable skill,\" he said. \"Talented students and also the students just trying to get the project done in office hours, they try to take shortcuts.\"\n",
      "And as a volunteer graduate student ambassador, Luigi helps incoming grad students transition to life at UB. He works to make their welcomes to campus warmer than his first confusing, snowy night here.\n",
      "\"I don't know if I'll try academia or industry,\" Luigi said. \"I've already taught, but maybe I'd like to have an internship and try industry.\"  Both great options to start an already promising career.\n",

This process is often automatic and part of web browser and website interactions and functions. This policy also identifies and describes how personal information may or may not be collected while navigating on official UB websites and associated third-party websites.\n",
      "Growth of privacy-related regulations and personal interest among visitors drive the increased demand for such policies, particularly on free consumer-oriented websites where visitors may not be aware their information is collected and used or sold for profit. Some examples include free web search portals, social media platforms, and personal email services. However, university web sites typically do not engage in such behavior because individuals are not visiting for consumer-aimed free services.\n",
      "This policy is almost exclusively focused on technical or mechanical aspects of information being exchanged to render website content. Other types of website privacy notices may include pop-ups about cookies, personal privacy policies, and notices of other privacy practices (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)).

      "While still an undergrad, Jacob Condello traveled to Seattle to attend one of the top international computer science education conferences.\n",
      "At the 2017 Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (ACM-SIGCSE) technical symposium, Jacob and collaborator Simran Singh showed off their research project, \"Building Tools, Gathering Data: Precursors for Assessing Students' Programming Process.\"\n",
      "Jacob credits CSE's Certificate in Data Intensive Computing program for his involvement in the project.  Certificates are non-degree-granting programs that enhance our degree programs by conveying deep knowledge in one specific research area.  The department offers several of them at the undergrad and grad levels.\n",
      "Jacob describes some of the courses that comprise the Certificate in Data Intensive Computing.  \"Bina Ramamurthy teaches CSE 487: Data Intensive Computing,\" he said.  \"You also have to take CSE 486: Distributed Systems and do a research project. Biological data science or anything in data science. That's what pointed me to data science. Carl Alphonce teaches using the Eclipse integrated development environment and became interested in collecting Eclipse data.\"\n",
      "The goal of the investigation, still in its preliminary phase, is to use programming data to identify struggling student programmers in order to deliver special assistance to them. \"The highlight of that project is finding a field I'm interested in, which is data science, and data intensive computing, and then seeking out the faculty to pursue it in more depth than the course offered.\" He later became a teaching assistant for Bina Ramamurthy, who is \"always on the lookout for interesting stuff.\"\n",
      "Jacob, a Webster, N.Y. native, is fielding multiple job offers in the Rochester, N.Y. area. His data science expertise, research work, teaching experience, and perfect 4.0 GPA make him an employer's ideal job candidate.\n",
      "\"Identifying the trending fields is important,\" he said. \"I chose UB because of the computer engineering program. Computer engineering provides more depth in electrical engineering and natural sciences. Computer engineering can be directly applicable to real problems, and there's a strong job market.\"\n",

      "B.S., Computer Science, May 2022 (expected)\n",
      "Sebastian Cisneros is an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He is also the president of the UB chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), which was founded in 1973 and is the nationâs largest association dedicated to fostering Hispanic leadership in STEM. At UB, the club coordinates MentorSHPE, an undergraduate mentoring program.\n",
      "Sebastian Cisneros with other SHPE members at the 2019 SHPE National Convention in Phoenix, Arizona.\n",
      "âMy favorite part about the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers is the amount of career opportunities that come with being involved with the club. â\n",
      "Sebastian Cisneros, undergraduate student\n",
      "Computer science\n",
      "Where are you from?\n",
      "I am from Jackson Heights in Queens, New York.\n",
      "Why did you choose to go into engineering?\n",
      "Since I was little I was interested in how machines and computers worked. That interest developed over time, but I would say that learning about robotics in my high school really solidified my decision to go into engineering.\n",
      "What do you like most about engineering at UB?\n",
      "I like that there are many opportunities to improve your skills and work on projects. Participating in BattleBots and hackathons were very rewarding experiences for me.\n",
      "Tell us about your involvement in the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE).\n",
      "I initially got involved with SHPE because my older relative was in SHPE and told me I should check it out. It was nice to be around others who shared similar interests with me, and came from a similar culture as well. What motivated me to become president was the ability to help others, just like previous members helped me.\n",
      "What's your favorite part of being in SHPE?\n",
      "My favorite part about SHPE is the amount of career opportunities that come with being involved with the club. Itâs always an exciting moment when a member receives an internship or full-time job offer after all their hard work. \n",
      "Is there anything new or particularly exciting that your organization is working on?\n",
      "At the moment we have been talking about the possibility of working on a BattleBot. This bot would be for our own learning experience, and not necessarily for use in the UB BattleBot competition.  \n",
      "What are you working on righrt now?\n",
      "Currently I am trying to learn a bit more about front end development in order to work on a few personal projects with my peers.\n",
      "What are you passionate about?\n",
      "Since working with robots in high school, Iâve had an interest in robotics and artificial intelligence. However, outside of school work Iâve always been passionate about skateboarding.\n",
      "Has there been a particular faculty or staff member that has been formative during your time at UB?\n",
      "There have been a few moments when certain professors have said something that has really stuck with me. One such moment that comes to mind is when Professor Ethan Blanton took a moment to talk to us about how imposter syndrome can affect anyone, and we are all capable of being successful.\n",
      "What are your future plans?\n",
      "Ideally, I want land a full-time offer that lets me work right after graduation. I want to be able to support my parents so they can finally rest after all the hard work theyâve done to get me where I am now.\n",
      "What is your advice for prospective students?\n",
      "My advice to prospective students would be to try and not fall into the trap of not needing to study because your first semester or two are easy. Aside from that I think itâs important to try and get involved with clubs that interest you at UB, as they could one day lead to career opportunities.\n",

      "Engineer, YouTube\n",
      "Kendra Claiborne, BS '15, Computer Science\n",
      "Believing in yourself: Kendra Claiborneâs journey through tech\n",
      "\"To the aspiring Black engineers, there is more than enough space in the industry for your knowledge and creativity and your input is needed, wanted and valued.\"\n",
      "Kendra Claiborne, Computer science alumna and engineer\n",
      "YouTube\n",
      "Since graduating with a BS  in computer science in 2015, Kendra Claiborne has brought her expertise to Huron Consulting Group, Deloitte Digital, Box and most recently, YouTube. Her experience at UB was essential for preparing her for life after college and setting her up for success. \n",
      "âThe knowledge that I gained from core computer science classes such as Data Structures and Algorithms provided me with the foundation for problem-solving in software development that I still draw from every day when designing and implementing technical solutions,â Claiborne says.\n",
      "But the road has not always been easy. âI recently achieved a career goal of working at my dream company with an amazing team. Iâm getting to do work that is fulfilling and impactful,â she says. âI set a goal of working at Google during my undergrad and did not know when or if it would even happen. It took me three tries over the span of four years to achieve it but diligence and continuous learning were the two main ingredients.â\n",
      "Kendra has recently persevered through a new challenge: beginning a new job mid-pandemic. âSince I started at YouTube in November of 2020, during what many of my peers and I term the âWork from Homeâ period, I have not had the opportunity to go into the office or meet my team in-person as of yet,â says Claiborne. âDespite these circumstances, I've really enjoyed working on a platform that I'm an avid user of âand delivering technical solutions that directly impact internal business operation usersâ ability to efficiently perform their roles.â\n",
      "We asked Kendra to reflect on her time in and out of the classroom at the University at Buffalo and share what sheâs learned with aspiring engineers and computer scientists.\n",
      "Whatâs a current project at YouTube that youâre working on that youâre excited about?\n",
      "I'm currently working on a project where we're implementing a notification delivery platform for internal business users in our partner management application. The notification feature will help business users to receive alerts and make actionable, timely, and intelligent decisions about their partners where historically they were unaware, delayed, or reactive when it came to events and trends that impacted their partner's ability to succeed on YouTube.\n",
      "This project involves UI/UX and backend services, so I get to do both frontend and backend development. Given the amount of user stories associated with the project, the module is incrementally implemented which means that we release something new every two weeks, receive feedback from users and push out new and/or enhanced functionality on a bi-weekly basis.\n",
      "Whatâs most exciting is that this is my first real project since joining the team and Iâm getting the opportunity to work on this project from the ground up which allows me to have design and technical input from the beginning.\n",
      "What were some formative experiences for you during your time at UB?\n",
      "Outside of the classroom, UB offered many opportunities to build soft skills by way of networking events, interacting with recruiters and software developers from top tech companies at career fairs and company campus visits, participating in STEM research through programs like the Louis Stokes Minority Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP). \n",
      "The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and student body clubs helped build my technical and non-technical skills and exposed me to communities and \"rooms\" that I normally would have been too shy to enter. One of my most memorable experiences at UB that cultivated an important purpose of mine was during my junior year when four other engineering students and I founded the student club UB Scientista, now known as UB DivTech. The organization's core goals were to create more awareness around the representation of women in engineering, particularly computer science, and increase this representation through community and networking events. Being a part of this group planted the seed that has since grown into a passion of improving the representation of underrepresented groups in the tech industry.\n",
      "What advice do you have for UB students who have recently graduated and will soon embark on their careers?\n",
      "To the rising and recent graduates, you made it to the starting line! I'm sure the warm-up was challenging, but it was necessary to give you the fortitude to take on your journey. There will be many paths that you can embark on throughout your journey and you may even get tripped up or take a less ideal path. Remember, mistakes are unavoidable and part of the journey, so prepare to make a ton of mistakes! When you make a mistake, how you react and your resiliency is what your peers will remember you by. Throughout my career, I've made mistakes that made me feel incompetent and doubt if I belonged. I learned that my peers did not define me and my abilities based on the mistakes I made but that how I addressed the issue is what left a lasting impression.\n",
      "Lastly, stepping out into the world, you may feel that people expect you to know everything, but that is not the case. You are an ever-evolving being and you'll gain so many lessons, experience and skills over your lifetime. Be vocal in what you do know and speak up when you need time to research the unknown. You can always say \"let me get back to you on that.\" Be confident in what you do know and willing to learn.\n",
      "Do you have any advice specifically for aspiring Black engineers?\n",
      "To the aspiring Black engineers, there is more than enough space in the industry for your knowledge and creativity and your input is needed, wanted and valued. I urge you to not let self-doubt or the demographic make-up of an environment dictate whether you belong or what you can accomplish. Given the current circumstances of Covid and with racial justice efforts being at the forefront of many companies' diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, it can feel suffocating. Take moments, as often as you need, to breathe and give yourself grace.\n",

      "Degree Conferral\n",
      "We provide quality, cutting-edge educational experiences to computing majors at the Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD levels.\n",
      "The Department aims to provide students with strong conceptual foundations (theoretical and experimental), and also expose them to the forefront of the developments in the field of computing. Recognizing the applicability of computing to all fields of knowledge and practice, the Department will provide a variety of degrees and programs at each of the degree levels, and will cooperate with other units of the University to provide interdisciplinary degree programs.\n",
      "Student Education\n",
      "We provide state-of-the-art education and training in the use of computers to UB students regardless of their majors.\n",
      "The Department's mission includes providing state-of-the-art computer education and training to all students at UB to bring them to the level of knowledge and ability required by their major. This includes bringing all UB students to a basic level of computing skills which all instructors may expect all their students to have, and other students to the level required by their majors, so that all instructors may expect their students to be able to use computers appropriately in their coursework. The computer, communications, and information industries are experiencing an intense shortage of appropriately trained employees. Many of these jobs are appropriate for students with majors not in the discipline of computing, but with a knowledge of computing beyond the minimal required by their own majors. The CSE Department's mission includes providing appropriate computer education to prepare students throughout UB for employment in the information technology workforce.\n",
      "Departmental Assistance\n",
      "We assist other UB departments in developing faculty computing expertise appropriate to their programs.\n",
      "The Department's mission includes supporting other UB departments to attract faculty with computing expertise appropriate to their programs, and to further develop the computing expertise of current faculty. Such support could include assistance with recruiting, offers of joint and adjunct appointments, and development of shared and collaborative research efforts and programs.\n",
      "Industrial Outreach\n",
      "We are a source of computing expertise to UB, Western New York, and New York State.\n",
      "The Department's mission includes industrial outreach and other methods of sharing its expertise with the University, the Region, and the State, as is appropriate for a department in a State University.\n",

      "Degree Conferral\n",
      "We provide quality, cutting-edge educational experiences to computing majors at the Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD levels.\n",
      "The Department aims to provide students with strong conceptual foundations (theoretical and experimental), and also expose them to the forefront of the developments in the field of computing. Recognizing the applicability of computing to all fields of knowledge and practice, the Department will provide a variety of degrees and programs at each of the degree levels, and will cooperate with other units of the University to provide interdisciplinary degree programs.\n",
      "Student Education\n",
      "We provide state-of-the-art education and training in the use of computers to UB students regardless of their majors.\n",
      "The Department's mission includes providing state-of-the-art computer education and training to all students at UB to bring them to the level of knowledge and ability required by their major. This includes bringing all UB students to a basic level of computing skills which all instructors may expect all their students to have, and other students to the level required by their majors, so that all instructors may expect their students to be able to use computers appropriately in their coursework. The computer, communications, and information industries are experiencing an intense shortage of appropriately trained employees. Many of these jobs are appropriate for students with majors not in the discipline of computing, but with a knowledge of computing beyond the minimal required by their own majors. The CSE Department's mission includes providing appropriate computer education to prepare students throughout UB for employment in the information technology workforce.\n",
      "Departmental Assistance\n",
      "We assist other UB departments in developing faculty computing expertise appropriate to their programs.\n",
      "The Department's mission includes supporting other UB departments to attract faculty with computing expertise appropriate to their programs, and to further develop the computing expertise of current faculty. Such support could include assistance with recruiting, offers of joint and adjunct appointments, and development of shared and collaborative research efforts and programs.\n",
      "Industrial Outreach\n",
      "We are a source of computing expertise to UB, Western New York, and New York State.\n",
      "The Department's mission includes industrial outreach and other methods of sharing its expertise with the University, the Region, and the State, as is appropriate for a department in a State University.\n",

      "At UB, Sanjee Choudhery became inspired to work in two distinct fieldsâcomputer engineering and neuroscienceâand found that she didn't need to choose one over the other.\n",
      "Her first step toward discovering this novel combination was as an undergraduate teaching assistant for Carl Alphonce and Kris Schindler.  \"They were really different experiences.  With Kris I did upper-level courses and with Carl I did 100-level courses.  It's really cool to see how the students have grown in just one to two years.  They're much better at figuring out their work so they're not staying up all night.\"\n",
      "During her junior year, she joined the Brain Connectivity project at Buffalo General Hospital, sponsored by the Center for Undergraduate Research & Creative Activities (CURCA) and led by UB neurologist Michael Dwyer. \n",
      "\"It was very interdisciplinary: biologists, people who knew how to code, computer science people.  It combined computer science and neurology.  I worked with MRI data for multiple sclerosis patients.  I'd like to continue that or do something similar in the medical field.\"\n",
      "Sanjee, who is from Clifton Park, N.Y., also found it easy to find her place in CSE.  \"UB is such a big campus, but computer science is a well-knit community if you choose to be a part of it.  It's not only certain groups of people with certain GPAs who can get involved.\" \n",
      "She herself has volunteered as UB Association for Computer Machinery (ACM) chapter vice president, '15-16; American Association of University Women (AAUW) Tech Savvy volunteer; and UB Hacking '16 co-director, with Meg Arnold.\n",
      "\"UB Hacking was a good event to network and meet other students who you could possibly collaborate with and make cool stuff.  I'm computer engineering, so I'm very good at hardware stuff, and I met people who are very good at software stuff.  In fact, that's how I met some of my current friends.  I was a sophomore, so I hadn't been exposed to Python, C++.  We got to work with a Raspberry Pi.\"\n",
      "Additionally, Sanjee has served as captain of an Indian fusion dance team, mixing traditional styles with western styles. Competing for the Indian Student Association, her team's 40-member tribute to Mahatma Gandhi won UB's 2016 International Fiesta dance competition. \"The event is a great way to celebrate and explore cultures around the world represented at UB,\" she said.\n",
      "Sanjee is heading to Stony Brook in Fall '17 to pursue her MS in Computer Engineering. Eventually, she wants to earn her PhD and work in interdisciplinary research.\n",

      "Growing up, Dominique Hickson wished she could have met some STEM role models in her neighborhood, people who could have helped explain scientific careers and help her choose her own direction. But science professionals were largely absent from her community. \n",
      "Nevertheless, Dominique decided to become an engineer during senior year of high school at Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, N.Y. A first-generation college student, she transferred to UB after one semester at UMass Dartmouth \"because of the low-cost in-state tuition and because UB is one of the top research institutions in the country.\"\n",
      "At first, Dominique struggled and found herself unprepared for some of the difficult course material. Her application to the engineering program was rejected a heartbreaking three times. But Dominique's parents had taught her a quality that's invaluable in situations like this: persistence. \"Anything you put your mind toward, you can accomplish it,\" she said.\n",
      "Methodically, she strengthened her portfolio. \"I got involved. Tutoring, research opportunities, support groups, student clubs at departments around UB,\" she recalled. Soon, good things started happening. She became a student assistant in the SEAS Undergraduate Office. She won a seat on the CSE Student Advisory Board. She also won the Collegiate Science & Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) 2016 summer research program best poster award for her work on autonomous mobile robot sensors with faculty member Karthik Dantu.\n",
      "\"Getting to know my professors helped a lot. They're phenomenal,\" she said. \"The personal relationship definitely helped. I can come to them without any fear.\"\n",
      "The fourth try was the charm, and Dominique won admittance to the engineering program in 2015.\n",
      "Dominique will enroll in the MS program in Fall '17 to work with Kris Schindler in Augmentative Technology for the Handicapped.  She intends to go all the way for her PhD, ultimately planning to teach computer science in low-income neighborhoods, such as at the community centers back home in Harlem. \"I want to help at-risk students and be a role model.  I want to increase the number of African-American men and women in engineering.\"\n",
      "She's going to take home the message, \"Hey, you can do this, too.\"\n",

      "Aosen Wang's first job was as an algorithm software engineer at Vimicro, a multimedia chip design firm not far from his hometown of Siping, in China's Ji Lin Province.  His job was strictly on the software side, tweaking code to improve chip efficiency.  It was a perfectly respectable start for the career of a graduate of the prestigious University of Science and Technology of China.  But Aosen suspected that greater victories were within reach.\n",
      "\"I realized that not so much could be improved at the software level,\" he said.  \"I wanted to get into the lower hardware layers where big performance improvements could be made.\"  Time delays could be foreshortened.  Accuracy improved.  He wanted to contribute his own innovative ideas to the field.  For that, he came to Buffalo.\n",
      "But, having arrived at UB, he discovered that the freedom to chart his own research course was unexpectedly daunting.  \"I was scared before coming here,\" he said.  \"Research is difficult, cutting-edge.  Maybe I don't have answers.\"\n",
      "Things improved when he found a kindred spirit in faculty advisor Wenyao Xu, who shares his interest in low power computer architecture design.  \"The most important thing has been help from my advisor,\" said Aosen. \"At our first meeting, he told me not to worry. He taught me how to do the research, the discussion, the background, which parts to pay attention to, and how to optimize the results.\"\n",
      "With Dr. Xu's help, Aosen found his groove.  \"I published my first paper after my first semester.\"  By his second year, he won the 2016 CSE Best Graduate Research Award.  \"I find it's not so difficult.  Research is a change process. From being scared to being interested in it.  Students and faculty are willing to help, just like family.  I can ask silly questions.  Algorithms and machine learning techniques.  At first, I feel the research is very difficult, but now I feel this is a very good topic.  I keep asking my advisor to let me work on more ideas.\"\n",

      "Sargur Srihari\n",
      "Sargur âHariâ Srihari, an internationally renowned UB professor of computer science who taught computers to read handwriting and significantly advanced the fields of pattern recognition, computational forensics and machine learning, died March 8 due to complications from a glioblastoma. He was 72.  \n",
      "A SUNY Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and UB faculty member for more than 40 years, Srihari established the university as a leading center for pattern recognition and machine learning. He founded the Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition (CEDAR), which did groundbreaking research for the U.S. Postal Service in the 1990s, ultimately teaching machines how to read handwritten envelopes. This work at CEDAR, which received total funding of more than $60 million over 25 years, led to handwritten digit recognition being recognized as the âfruit flyâ of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n",
      "âDr. Srihari was, quite simply, a towering figure in computer science,â said President Satish K. Tripathi. âAlways at the cutting edge of innovation, he transformed pattern recognition, machine learning and computational forensics with findings that brought global renown to UB and had a profound impact on society.\n",
      "âBeyond his truly exceptional research contributions, Hari was a devoted university citizen and dedicated mentor. In his own patient, gentle and encouraging manner, he inspired generations of aspiring computer scientists to excel in their own right,â Tripathi said.\n",
      "âAs we at UB join the worldâs computer science community in mourning the passing of this incomparable scholar, I would like to offer my heartfelt condolences to Hariâs wife, Professor Rohini Srihari, his children and his entire family.â\n",
      "Srihariâs research advances, which have received seven U.S. patents, paved the way for the handwriting-recognition technology that is used in modern systems ranging from tablets to scanners. His early research work on 3D imaging also remains influential in fields such as 3D printing.\n",
      "Srihari later would become a pioneer in the field of computational forensics. In 2002, he conducted the first computationally based research to establish the individuality of handwriting, with important implications for the criminal justice community.\n",
      "This work led to the first automated system, known as CEDAR-FOX, for determining whether two handwritten samples came from the same or different writers. The handwriting work was eventually extended to comparing fingerprints and footwear prints. The work led to Srihari being invited to serve as the only computer scientist on a National Academy of Sciencesâ committee that produced an influential 2009 report on strengthening forensic sciences in the U.S. that has had a major impact in courts worldwide.\n",
      "âThis is a tremendous loss, not only for UBâs computer science and engineering family, but for the world of computer science,â said Jinhui Xu, professor and chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. âHari was greatly admired by his students, UB faculty members and researchers throughout the world.â\n",
      "Kemper Lewis, dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, called Srihari âa renowned researcher in artificial intelligenceâ who was a âwidely respected expert in statistical pattern recognition and deep learning.â\n",
      "âHari cherished his role as a researcher, professor and scientist, and he will be deeply missed by his department, our school and our university,â Lewis said.\n",
      "Srihari is survived by his wife of 45 years, Rohini, UB professor of computer science and engineering; his sons, Dileep Srihari and Ashok Srihari (Caroline); and granddaughter, Vera Srihari.\n",
      "A memorial fund, the Professor Sargur (Hari) Srihari Memorial Fund, has been established to support student scholarships. Donations can be made here.\n",
      "Born in Bangalore, India, Srihari earned an undergraduate degree in electrical and communication engineering from the world-renowned Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore in 1970. Immigrating to the U.S. later that year, he obtained an MS (1972) and PhD (1976), both in computer and information science, from The Ohio State University. His doctoral thesis focused on the design and evaluation of classification algorithms for a type of pattern recognition related to radar aircraft identification.\n",
      "After receiving his PhD, Srihari joined the faculty at Wayne State University. He came to UB in 1978.\n",
      "During his career, Srihari authored more than 350 research papers with 20,000 citations (h-index=64); edited five books; and served as principal adviser to 40 doctoral students.\n",
      "He was the recipient of numerous honors, among them the IAPR/ICDAR Outstanding Achievements Award in 2011 for his outstanding and continued contributions to research and education in handwriting recognition and document analysis, and services to the community; the Distinguished Alumnus of the Ohio State University College of Engineering in 1999; and the UB Excellence in Graduate Mentoring Award in 2018.\n",
      "He held fellowships in the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR) and the Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineers (IETE, India), and was a life fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).\n",
      "In his later years, Srihari remained an active faculty member, continuing to teach and supervise graduate students. He also developed an extensive set of lecture slides for machine learning, which are widely used in courses around the world.\n",
      "His final teaching efforts were focused on integrating the wealth of research being produced in deep learning from various books, papers and blogs. He served as a visiting professor and scientist at his alma mater, the Indian Institute of Science, during spring 2020, and later established a scholarship there. During the pandemic, he began recording videos of his explanation of topics in deep learning, and did livestreaming as well.\n",
      "He enjoyed traveling with Rohini to Washington, D.C., and Florida to visit their sons and granddaughter. He also continued to read avidly while pursuing his lifelong love of history, science and gardening.\n",

      "When Lavone Rodolph was laid off by the major defense contractor that had employed him for five years, he took it as a blessing.   It was his chance to come back to UB to earn his PhD.\n",
      "Today, Lavone invents innovative ways to speed data transfer in computer networks.  The goal is to optimize network efficiency and hasten data traffic rates; the means is building multipath overlay virtual networks on existing physical networks and writing software that minimizes network traffic bottlenecks. He is advised by Tevfik Kosar.\n",
      "His other passion is stepping out of the lab and into the community, personifying STEM achievement for Buffalo schoolchildren and post-secondary students.\n",
      "In high school, Lavone himself was a beneficiary of UB's STEM community outreach programs.  During sophomore year at Buffalo's Hutch Tech (Hutchinson Central Technical) high school, UB's Science and Technology Enrichment Program (STEP) and Buffalo Engineering Awareness for Minorities (BEAM) programs guided him into STEM, specifically computer engineering.\n",
      "At UB, he joined the university-level version of STEP, the Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP).  Junior year, he won the Computer Science and Engineering Mathematics (CSEMS) Scholarship;  senior year, the Kaplan Scholarship.\n",
      "After his years in industry, it was time to give back, to assume the leadership role that he'd been preparing for, maybe inadvertently, his entire life.  Now on the other side of the desk, he teaches the CSTEP summer research methods seminar and BEAM tutorials on engineering fundamentals such as UNIX, HTML, and the mathematical engine Maple.\n",
      "In 2012, he got involved with Joseph Gardella's Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (ISEP), an NSF-funded collaborative that brings together the Buffalo Public Schools, UB, Buff State, and the Buffalo Science Museum to engage middle school and high school students in STEM.  \"Students need to be exposed to basic, preliminary concepts before high school.  You've got to get them in the pipeline in middle school,\" Lavone said. \"Make it fun, creative, exciting.\"  One of the projects he leads is development of an Android app whose \"bottom line is to give them exposure to programming.\"\n",
      "He cites two favorite quotes that guide and inspire him: \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me\" (Philippians 4:13) and \"I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed.\" (Booker T. Washington)\n",
      "As for the future, Lavone has had his fill of defense contractors, at which stable employment depends on uninterrupted streams of federal dollars.  \"I'd love to be a tenured university professor someday,\" to realize his dual mission of research and outreach.\n",
